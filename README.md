# Stitch

This is a port of Sam Stephenson's [Stich](https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch) and Alex MacCaw's [Stitch-rb](https://github.com/maccman/stitch-rb) to ASP.NET. Stitch allows you to:

> Develop and test your JavaScript applications as CommonJS modules in Node.js. Then __Stitch__ them together to run in the browser.

In other words, this is a [CommonJS](http://dailyjs.com/2010/10/18/modules/) JavaScript package management solution. It's terribly simple, bundling up all your applications JavaScript files without intelligently resolving dependencies. However, unless your application is very modular, it turns out thats all you need.
